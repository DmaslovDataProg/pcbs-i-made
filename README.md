You can find several PCBs that I have designed. 
# Breadboard power supply
Power supply two-layer Printed circuit Board(PCB) made from scratch that can be inserted in the breadboard and power both rails of the breadboard.

## Future implementations: 
1) Fix the silkscreen.
2) Deliver the complete PCB design.
3) Modify the PCB with the USB input.
4) Create a tiny solar power supply.
