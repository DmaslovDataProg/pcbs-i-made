You can find several PCBs that I have designed. 
# Breadboard power supply
Power supply two-layer Printed circuit Board(PCB) made from scratch that can be inserted in the breadboard and power both rails of the breadboard.

## Tiny power supply 
A tiny solar power supply similar to those found in garden lights, but with a voltage regulator.

## Future implementations: 
1) Modify both PCB with the USB input.
2) Design MCU logger circuit.
